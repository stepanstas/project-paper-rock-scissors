# Rock Paper Scissors Project

As an assignment for The Odin Project, I created a simple rock-paper-scissors game using html, css and javascript.

I have learned about:

- DOM Manipulation 
- Comparison Operators
- Conditional statements
- Creating and calling functions

The project can be seen live here: https://stepanstas.github.io/project-rock-paper-scissors/
